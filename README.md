# Number Guess React Project

## Description
This project has the following requirements:
- Build out a simple wireframe using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/LklOyr) or a similar tool
- Create a GitHub repository for the game and do regular add/commits for multiple 'save points'
- Assure that the game has multiple components and use props to pass data from parent components into child components
- Use state (the `useState()` hook) when needed to store data within a component
- Practice writing component rendering logic both within the JSX AND within component methods that then call within the JSX
- Assure that the game incorporates click events or other event types
- Use conditional rendering to show and hide at least one component or section within the app
- Use ES6 syntax as a challenge whenever possible: arrow functions, destructuring, the spread operator, object property value shorthand, template literals, etc
- Personalize the game! Use styles, images, sounds, and custom text to build something to be proud of
- Make the game safe-for-work
