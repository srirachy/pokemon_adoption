# Employee Directory React Project

## Description
This project has the following requirements:
- Build out a simple wireframe using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/tUFdgq) or a similar tool
- Create a project board using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to track tasks, priorities, deadlines, and for visibility into what each partner is working on
- App should have multiple components. Use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components
- App should start with an array of data either contained in an in-project `.json` file, or should request data from an external API on initial render. This data should be saved in state
- App should allow the user to add a new item by completing and submitting an HTML form
- Form should include at least one less traditional form field type: select menu, radio buttons, checkboxes, date input, etc
- Use controlled form elements so that as soon as the values stored in the form fields change, the corresponding state value is updated. The project should handle all form logic by hand and should not use React form libraries
- The form's `submit` button should be disabled until the user has completed all of the required fields
- App should use a table (or similar structure) to render the data in the app in an understandable fashion
- App should have a search field that filters the data displayed to match the search term
- App should allow sorting of the data on at least one field, both ascending and descending
- Make code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible 

This project utilizes SASS, JS, and React to run.
